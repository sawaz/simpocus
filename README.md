# simpocus
Low fidelity open source ultrasound simulator

This project stems from EDUS2 ultrasound simulator. https://github.com/asclepius/edus2/


Main differences are:
Feature wise:
- it is possible to change the ultrasound images associated to a tag during the simulation
- the user interaction is shown on the remote controller (videos are played on both machines, tag being scanned is highlighted

Software wise:
- re-developed in Python using wx libraries

UI wise:
- software is compatible with EDUS2 scenario files
- each tag has also a graphical placeholder that helps when the tags need to be moved from a manikin to another one
